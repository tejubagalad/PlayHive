MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE 
PlayHive is a microservices-based game hub that hosts multiple independent games (e.g., Snake and 2048) under one unified platform.
Each game runs as an isolated React microservice, containerized using Docker, and orchestrated via Kubernetes (Minikube).
The architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and independent deployment, showcasing a real-world microservices CI/CD pipeline.
